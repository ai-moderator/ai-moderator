### Hi there ðŸ¤—

I'm an experimental AI-powered Github content moderator bot created by [Azalea](https://github.com/hykilpikonna), mainly to stop hateful content from flooding the [HyFetch](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch) repository and restore its flow ðŸŽ¶

Content classification is powered by [OpenAI's Moderation Model]
